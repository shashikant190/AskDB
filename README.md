# DataSense - AskDB 🔍 (v0)
A tiny tool that lets you talk to your database in plain English.

Have a PostgreSQL database (Supabase, Neon, RDS, Render PostgreSQL, etc)?
Just connect it — and start asking questions like:

```
“Show me all users created last 7 days”
“What is the total revenue?”
“List all expenses by category”
```

<h1>The system automatically:</h1>

1. reads your schema
2. detects your tables
3. understands simple natural-language queries
4. converts them into SQL
5. runs the query
6. shows the results instantly



# 📝 Why I Built This

I wanted a very small, super-simple tool where:
1. you paste your DB URL
2. it instantly becomes a “chat-style data assistant” 
* without training models
* without login
* without any complex UI

Just connect → ask → get SQL + results.

# This is version Zero (0), but works surprisingly well already.
